  <hr>

<p>Vin ate well last night. She'd had to kill for it though. A small, sweet apple with a pound of uncontaminated meat. The beef would last a few days if she was careful. The last time she ate this good was when Ava managed to steal a bag full of food from the Senate. Vin had been jealous it was not her who had sealed the feast for her people. Ava had come back with several loaves of bread that weren't mouldy, some small but fresh fruit and vegetables, and as they reached the bottom they found several beef steaks and two whole chickens. The camp had laughed that night.
<p>Ava told them of large, furnished rooms, carved marble pillars, gold edged railings, and the delectable smell of hot meat, gravy, vegetables and spiced wine. Vin always wondered how much truth she spoke; she was sure Ava had only thieved the food from a supply cart on the edges of Nova Roma. Vin knelt on the floor to rummage through her bag. The air smelled of the night fires her people huddled around for warmth, safety, to cook any live vermin they found and to boil water to drink or wash.
<p>Drinking was always a priority. Vin shook her flask of water; it would not last the night. She left her room, flask in hand and looked both ways. It was not unusual for her to walk the broken hallways, steps and floors of their war ravaged hotel alone, but she always preferred it at her Master's side. There were a few rooms that still had four walls in the hotel they called home. Oliver, her master and their leader, occupied the largest and Vin the next. Several of his guardsmen and the founding members of their group were allocated the others. It was a period hotel that had tried to keep its charm, and from the sign on the corner of one of the three remaining walls, they were in Notting Hill.
<p>Voices, loud and brash came from the left; Henry and his mob. They were confident, thuggish men that liked to think they ruled in Oliver’s absence. It was not that Vin disliked them, and they were only sometimes rude to her, but she turned the other way. On her twelfth step she jumped over a small hole, enough to sprain an ankle. A brass candelabra signalled the end of the 'jarls' quarters and she turned, walking briskly down the stairs. A makeshift bannister had been erected where a wall had once been. She passed a young girl, sallow eyed and pale. Annelle, she thought her name was. She stared. Vin gave a little smile and a quiet 'heya'. A nod was her reply.
<p>People had settled in their rooms for the night. She saw silhouettes undressing behind their thin curtains; a couple kissing; a young mother teaching her daughter to sew. She tried to listen to their conversations but her steps were quick tonight, and she only managed to hear a few stray words. Another flight of steps and she was on ground level. At the last step, the floor was a crumble of earth with blunt edges of plaster and concrete that was once walls. A path had been worked through the mix to where the main campfire was, with a few huts around the edges that acted as dining, drinking and gambling halls, and often all three.
<p>They were quiet tonight. Vin supposed it was because Oliver was still out on a night scavenge with several of his best men. One of the huts was built onto the exposed lobby - or what remained of it. An old reception desk now made for a humble bar. The framework of the hotel used to poke through the scramble of brick and plaster, but they had been taken years ago for better use. And Vin stepped inside one of those better uses - their bar. It was the largest and most well-kept place in their camp and had been titled Wolf Hall in honour of their fallen leader and friend, Fenrir. Vin missed him every day. If Oliver left her alone at nights she would sometimes slip a hand between her legs and think of him. She often wondered how different life would have been with him as her master. As one of the men sitting at a table playing solitaire looked at her as she walked in, and seeing the mistrust in his eyes, she knew it wouldn't have been much different. She would still be what she was.
Vin took a seat on a cracked stool and gave the barkeep a smile.
<p>‘Whad'ya want, missy?’
<p>‘Some water. Can I have a kettle?’
<p>He sniffed and nodded to a barrel in the corner where they kept the day's supply of water.
<p>‘You'd best be quick. Oliver's men will be thirsty when they get back.’
<p>‘Yeah, yeah,’ she said quietly as she took the kettle the barkeep handed her and scooped her ration.
<p>‘Can I have a cup of your blackberry wine, please?’ she called as she left the bar and walked towards the communal fire pit. Vin heard him swear and mumble something. It was probably unpleasant, but he had already pissed Oliver off this week by letting some girls have more than their allocated ration of water, so he would never say it to her face.
<p>A familiar face greeted Vin as she hung the kettle above the fire pit. Ava. She was loud, friendly and with a face that didn't fit their surroundings. It was as if Ragnarok had passed her by. Her skin was smooth, her smile sweet and her hair as dark as Hel’s sky.  Yet beneath her kind demeanour was the heart of a Valkyrie, and Vin loved her for it.
<p>‘Oli not back yet?’ she asked pointlessly, looking around the camp.
<p>‘I can walk free in here you know,’ Vin replied, joining Ava. They sat on what used to be a supporting pillar of the hotel, with scars like claw marks in the stone. It was comfortable enough.
<p>‘I know that, he's just been a while.’
<p>A young couple stood up as their kettle trembled, never breaking conversation. They left behind an old woman, sewing together a child’s dress and a handsome man that Vin was always pleased to see. He was called Fjoll and had a strong jaw with a neatly trimmed beard and eyes that were often lost in thought. He did not speak much, but Vin didn't care. Watching him sitting with a piece of charcoal and dirty paper, drawing whatever he pleased was enough for her. It would never happen. She had a master, and only he could touch.
v‘Nothing to worry about,’ said Vin as she tilted her head, enjoying the pleasant click of her neck.
<p>‘You wanna know something?’
<p>‘What?’
<p>‘I found a book shop. Untouched,’ said Ava with a lopsided smile.
Vin sat up straight, pushing back her thick hair from her face. ‘They all still intact?’
<p>‘It’s like Ragnarok didn’t happen. Except the glass and dust and shit all over the floor,’ said Ava, playing with the metal hoop that sat in the middle of her bottom lip.
<p>‘Find anything good?’ asked Vin.
<p>‘I didn’t get much of a chance to look - and you know I ain’t much of a reader.’
<p>Vin relaxed, leaning forward on her arms as she watched the steam rise from the kettle. ‘You managed a page of that last book I showed you,’ said Vin, picking at her fingers. She wanted to stand up, to leave, to run to that bookshop and never return. 
Ava nudged Vin’s shoulder with her own. ‘We ain’t had a lesson in a while. Up for one tomorrow?’
<p>‘On one condition,’ said Vin, turning to Ava. She smiled, returning the shoulder nudge. ‘We go to the bookshop. Provided Oli says yes.’
<p>‘I got a condition too,’ said Ava, pulling apart Vin’s restless hands. 
<p>‘What?’ asked Vin.
<p>‘Drop this spear thing. It’s not gonna end good, Vin.’
Vin pulled back her hand, sitting back upright. She stared at the kettle, listening at the faint whistle that signalled it was almost done. ‘No.’
<p>‘It’s been what, four years since that shit, Vin. Why now?’ asked Ava, loud enough for their ears only.
Vin took a long, steady breath, still unwilling to look away from the kettle. It sang louder, now. 
<p>‘Because I’m older. I’m stronger. Oli’s slackened his leash enough. And,’ she paused for effect and glanced at Ava. Her head was sat in her hand and she was watching Vin carefully. ‘And,’ she resumed, ‘Oli will help.’
<p>Ava laughed. ‘He’ll help you get Gungnir? Bull. Shit.’
<p>Vin hushed Ava and dug her heel into her foot. ‘Shut the fuck up. And of course he won’t help me get it. But if I help him find it… I can get it.’
<p>Ava sat up, shaking her head. The rings in her dreadlocks clinked pleasantly, a melody to the harmony of her laugh. ‘You watched Fenrir die for that thing. And yet you still want it.’
<p>Of course I want it, she thought, silencing her angry words; Ava was her only friend. An abrupt voice interrupted her thoughts.
<p>‘I'm not a fucking waiter, Vin,’ said old Bryn as he thrust the cup of blackberry wine at her face, spilling a drop on her chest. ‘Especially not-‘ He stopped talking, conscious of the eyes watching him. ‘An extra coin that'll be now.’
<p>Vin stuck a hand into her frayed jeans and flicked a five pence at him. ‘Sorry, Bryn.’
<p>They watched him hobble away, shaking his head.
<p>‘And yes. I still want it. I can’t  - and won’t - let Fenrir die for nothing.’
<p>Ava stared at the fire and shrugged. ‘What else can I do to talk you outta this stupid idea?’
<p>‘Nothing.’
<p>Vin took a sip of her wine. It was strong and bitter, but it was all they had. A long silence lingered between the girls. Eventually, Vin broke it as she shared the rest with Ava and as she set down her cup, the kettle sang.
<p>‘I think I’ll head to bed once this has cooled,’ she said to Ava. She put the kettle at their feet. The warm steam was pleasant.
<p>‘We’re still on for tomorrow?’ asked Vin, curving her feet around the hot kettle. 
<p>‘When were we off?’ said Ava, leaning against Vin’s shoulder. Her dreads draped across Vin’s bare arm, tickling the skin.
<p>‘When you got all pissy at me.’
<p>‘Girl, we’re always pissy.’
<p>Vin Laughed. ‘Let me sweet talk Oli when he’s back.’
<p>She lifted the kettle to sit on her knees as it cooled; the wind had turned brisk as the moon rose higher. The girls talked for a while, but as their last company left – the quiet Fjoll with a handful of sketches – Vin decided it was time she left too. Bryn was closing up and the quiet of sleep was descending faster than she realised. Filling her flask, she rose from her seat.
<p>‘Meet me at Wolf Hall by noon… if Oliver says it’s okay,’ said Ava as she watched her leave.
<p>Vin gave her a smile as they parted. Ava stayed on the other side of the hotel in a room that had only a small part of wall missing and was even south facing – she had chosen well. Vin returned the empty kettle to a busy Bryn, who ignored her. The silhouettes were few as she walked back to her room. Candles and lamps were used only when necessary; you didn’t need a light to talk, have sex or sleep. Nothing was private – but Vin couldn’t remember when it ever was.
